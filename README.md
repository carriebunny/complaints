## Improving Customer Experience through Predictive Complaint Management
I analyzed and predicted future complaints using data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which contained 2.6 million observations over 11 years.
I gained insights into the nature of complaints filed and developed predictive models using regression analysis, machine learning, and data science in Python to improve customer experience and reduce future complaints. My analysis uses the most recent 3 years of data from the 11-year dataset to ensure relevance and timeliness.
